## Introduction:   

 

This website was designed for a local fishing club based in Maesteg, South Wales.   

 

This website has been created the intial milestone project for Code Institute's Level 5 Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. GitPod was used for writing the code, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub, where it was stored.     

 

Once all the code had been written, GitPages was then used to deploy the website.

Site map – potentials  ?? 

 

 

### Skeleton   

 

At this level, the exact structure is finalised, including where the interface elements are located on the screen and how they interact with each other.    

 

 [Wireframes](WIREFRAME.md "Link to Wireframe screenshots") were created to set out the initial appearance of the website.  Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).     

 

 

### Surface   

 

This is the final stage where visual design should be designed with the user in mind. The information should be presented appropriately and accessibility should be considered.   

 

 Colour scheme:   

The colour scheme for the project was created by uploading an image of the Llynfi River to Adobe Color. Adobe Color extracted the colours from the image to create the colour scheme:
